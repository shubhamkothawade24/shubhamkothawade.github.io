                <h1 class="title">1. Ingenious Electric Vehicle Design and Development Unveiled</h1>
                <p>Embarking on an odyssey of innovation and engineering prowess, we spearheaded the conceptualization, development, meticulous testing, and ultimate realization of an exemplary electric two-wheeler. This exceptional creation bore the hallmark of catering to a diverse spectrum of riders, tailored specifically for students, ladies, and venerable individuals. The hallmark of its ingenuity lay in its braking system, showcasing an avant-garde, mechanically operated Anti-lock Braking System (ABS), setting a new benchmark in safety and performance.</p>
        
                <p>This revolutionary feat was accomplished under the aegis of Team Phalanx, a distinguished Motorsports club renowned for its astute vehicle design, construction, and fervent participation in racing events. The creation of this groundbreaking electric vehicle was meticulously carried out under the aegis of the Electric Vehicle department within Team Phalanx, known as the Team Phalanx Electric Vehicle Club.</p>
        
                <p>Steering our innovation onto the competitive platform, our brainchild took center stage at the Society of Automotive Engineer's Electric Two-Wheeler competition. Garnering remarkable acclaim, our creation clinched the prestigious All India Rank 3, a testament to its exceptional engineering and design. My name is Shubham Kothawade, and I am privileged to have not only been an integral part of this pioneering team but also had the distinct honor of leading this exceptional group for over a span of two illustrious years.</p>
